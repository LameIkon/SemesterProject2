Take some food, it will be necessary. You should also bring a lantern. The sun no longer rises this time of the year.

        Though, you shouldn't take too much. We are running low on provisions, and getting more here is not an easy task. Perhaps we should hunt for meat while you are out.

                You should also place some firewood in the furnace, it's getting cold.

    If they have reached the hut in Denmark's Harbour and got the provisions from the stash, there is no doubt in my mind that they all very well are alive.

            But nothing is safe in Greenland, the weather is brutal. If their sled dogs have died, they can't go very far. Pushing a sled is no easy task.
