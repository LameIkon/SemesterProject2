Starting cutscene:
Ejnar:
In 1907 three men never returned from their trip.
They set out to map the Northen part of Greenland.
I have assembled a crew to find these lost men.
Whatever it takes we will bring them back.
This is the story of how that unfolded.




Ending 1 Iver dies:

Iver never returned. 
We sent out to look for him.
He layed there in the snow, lifeless.
With no time to spare we set sail home.
As we return, we shall tell his story.


Ending 2 the map returned:
Ejnar:
Iver returned with the map in hand.
But it was not without loss.

Their legacy will live on throughout time.
As we return, we shall tell their story.
